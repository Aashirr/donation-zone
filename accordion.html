                                       Antibiotic, chemical substance produced by a living organism, generally a microorganism, that is detrimental to other microorganisms. Antibiotics commonly are produced by soil microorganisms and probably represent a means by which organisms in a complex environment, such as soil, control the growth of competing microorganisms.
                                       Antibiotics are substances that are used to treat bacterial infections. Some antibiotics also act as antiprotozoal substances, which means they are effective against protozoan infections. However, no antibiotics are effective at combating viruses, hence, to curb viral infections, anti-viral drugs are used.
                                       The origins of the term “antibiotics” can be traced back to the 1800s’ when French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin introduced the term “antibiosis”, which meant “against life”. He used this term to describe the properties of early antibacterial drugs. The actual term “antibiotics” was first used by Selman Waksman in 1942 to describe the inhibitory effects of substances produced by microorganisms to other microorganisms.

                                 Nearly everyone has taken an antibiotic. This type of medicine fights bacterial infections. Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic for things like strep throat or an ear infection. Antibiotics work either by killing bacteria or halting their multiplication so that the body's immune system can fight off the infection.
                                 Sometimes a part of the body can't make enough of a chemical. That can also make you sick. Someone with insulin-dependent diabetes, for instance, has a pancreas that can't produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates glucose in the body). Some people have a low production of thyroid hormone, which helps control how the body uses energy. In each case, doctors can prescribe medicines to replace the missing hormone

                                 Medicines are chemicals or compounds used to cure, halt, or prevent disease; ease symptoms; or help in the diagnosis of illnesses. Advances in medicines have enabled doctors to cure many diseases and save lives. These days, medicines come from a variety of sources.
                                 Medicine is an ancient and complex social phenomenon, variously seen as art, science and witchcraft. These visions share the goal of curing disease.
                                 Medicines act in a variety of ways. Some can cure an illness by killing or halting the spread of invading germs, such as bacteria and viruses. Others are used to treat cancer by killing cells as they divide or preventing them from multiplying. Some drugs replace missing substances or correct low levels of natural body chemicals such as some hormones or vitamins. Medicines can even affect parts of the nervous system that control a body process.

                                 Some medicines treat symptoms but can't cure the illness that causes the symptoms. (A symptom is anything you feel while you're sick, such as a cough or nausea.) So taking a lozenge may soothe a sore throat, but it won't kill that nasty strep bacteria.
                                 Some medicines relieve pain. If you pull a muscle, your doctor might tell you to take ibuprofen or acetaminophen. These pain relievers, or analgesics, don't get rid of the source of the pain — your muscle will still be pulled. What they do is block the pathways that transmit pain signals from the injured or 
                                 irritated body part to the brain (in other words, they affect the way the brain reads the pain signal) so that you don't hurt as much while your body recovers.

                                 Among the most important medicines are immunizations (or vaccines). These keep people from getting sick in the first place by immunizing, or protecting, the body against some infectious diseases. Vaccines usually contain a small amount of an agent that resembles a specific germ or germs that have been modified or killed. When someone is vaccinated, it primes the body's immune system to "remember" the germ so it will be able to fight off infection by that germ in the future.
                                 Most immunizations that prevent you from catching diseases like measles, whooping cough, and chickenpox are given by injection. No one thinks shots are fun. But the diseases they prevent can be very serious and cause symptoms that last much longer than the temporary discomfort of the shot. To make life easier, now you can get immunizations at many pharmacies.
                                 As people get older, they sometimes develop chronic or long-term conditions. Medicines can help control things like high blood pressure (hypertension) or high cholesterol. These drugs don't cure the underlying problem, but they can help prevent some of its body-damaging effects over time.

                                 Taking Medicines
                                 No matter what type of medicine your doctor prescribes, it's always important to be safe and follow some basic rules:
                                 If you feel worse after taking a medicine, tell your doctor right away.

                              </p>
                           </div>

                              <p>
                                 Double-check that you have the right medicine. If you get the same prescription filled more than once, check that it's the same shape, size, and color as the last time. If not, be sure to ask the pharmacist about it.
                                 Read the label and follow directions. Ask if you have questions.
                                 Take medicines exactly as prescribed. If the instructions say take one tablet four times a day, don't take two tablets twice a day. It's not the same.
                                 Ask if the medicine is likely to affect everyday tasks such as driving or concentrating in school.
                                 Don't take more medicine than is recommended. It won't make you heal faster or feel better quicker. In fact, an overdose of medicine can make you sick.
                                 Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions. For instance, he or she may tell you to take a medicine with food to help lessen the stomach upset it can cause or instead to take the medicine on an empty stomach so as not to interfere with the medicine's absorption into your body.

                                 Never share prescription medicine with anyone else, even if that person has the same thing as you do. Today's medicines are very complex, and the dosages tend to be precisely prescribed for each person's needs. Either under-dosing or overdosing can be harmful. 
                                 Additionally, someone else's body may react differently to the same medicine (for example, if the person has an allergy to one of the components of the medicine).

                                 If you have any allergies, tell your doctor and pharmacist before they start you on a new medicine.
                                 If you get a rash, start itching, vomiting, or have trouble breathing after starting a medicine, tell your parents immediately. Breathing difficulty, breaking out in hives, or suddenly developing swelling of the tongue, lips, face, or other body parts may be signs of a severe allergic reaction — get emergency medical care right away.

                                 Taking medicines may feel like a hassle sometimes. But medicines are the most effective treatments available for many illnesses. If you ever have any questions about what a medicine does or how you should take it, talk with your doctor or a pharmacist.
                                 Medicine is considered as one of the most important necessity to all of us. It is derived from the Latin words ars medicina meaning "the art of healing
